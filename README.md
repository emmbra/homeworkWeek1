# HTML CSS GIT: Code Refactor

## Description 

Performed a code refactor of a webpage to meet accessibility standards including:

* HTML source code uses semantic HTML5 allowing screen readers to better navigate the page and search engines to better data mine the page.
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* HTML img elements have accessible alt attributes.
* HTML heading attributes fall in sequential order.
* Title element is concise and descriptive.
* CSS styling refactored to be less redundant when possible.
